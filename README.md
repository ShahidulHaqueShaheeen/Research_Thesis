# Research_Thesis â€” BRAC University

This project involves conducting an undergraduate thesis focused on deep learning for image classification, aimed at developing an advanced external disease detection system for cattle.

## Overview
- Conducted an undergraduate thesis on Deep Learning (Image Classification) under the supervision of **Dr. Jannatun Noor**.
- Title: **CattleSavior: Towards Implementing an Advanced External Disease Detection System through Deep Learning**.
- Explored various deep learning architectures to enhance the accuracy of disease detection in cattle images.
- Utilized frameworks such as **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for model development and training.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall** to ensure reliable disease detection.
